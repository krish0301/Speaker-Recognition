# 🎤 Speaker Recognition using Keras

This project implements a basic speaker recognition model using Keras and TensorFlow. The model is trained to classify audio features based on the speaker’s voice characteristics.

## 📁 Files
- `SpeakerRecognition_Keras.ipynb` – Jupyter notebook with the full code for model building and training
- `requirements.txt` – Required Python packages
- `.gitignore` – Files and folders to be ignored by Git

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/krish0301/SpeakerRecognition.git
   cd SpeakerRecognition
   ```

2. Install the dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Run the notebook:
   Open `SpeakerRecognition_Keras.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook or Jupyter Lab and run all cells.
